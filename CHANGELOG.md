## [Unreleased]

### Added
- map/flat_map now accept an `error_fn` to transform the result of an
  unsuccessful future ([#153](https://github.com/rohanpm/more-executors/issues/153)).

## [2.1.2] - 2019-06-26

### Fixed
- Fixed a race condition with RetryExecutor which could occasionally result in a future
  being retried after a request to cancel
  ([#150](https://github.com/rohanpm/more-executors/issues/150))

## [2.1.1] - 2019-06-16

### Fixed
- Avoid spurious "cannot schedule new futures after interpreter shutdown" tracebacks
  ([#144](https://github.com/rohanpm/more-executors/issues/144))

### Changed
- Most functions in `more_executors.futures` will now immediately raise a
 `TypeError` if invoked with a non-future value where a future is expected.
 ([#146](https://github.com/rohanpm/more-executors/issues/146))

## [2.1.0] - 2019-06-05

  with a return value of `None`.
