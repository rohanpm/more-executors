def f_proxy(f, **kwargs):
    """Proxy calls on a future through to the future's result.

    The value returned by this function is a future resolved with the
    same result (or exception) as the input future ``f``.  It will also
    proxy most attribute lookups and method calls through to the
    underlying result, awaiting the result when needed.

    Note that since the returned value is intended to remain usable as
    a ``Future``, this proxy is relatively conservative and avoids
    proxying functionality which would clash with the ``Future``
    interface.

    Functionality which is not proxied includes:

    - conversion to boolean (``__bool__``)
    - conversion to string (``__str__``, ``__repr__``)
    - methods relating to object identity (``__eq__``, ``__hash__``)

    Signature: :code:`Future<X> ‚ü∂ Future<X>`

    Arguments:
        f (~concurrent.futures.Future)
            Any future.
        timeout (float)
            Timeout applied when awaiting the future's result
            during proxied calls.

    Returns:
        :class:`~concurrent.futures.Future`
            a Future which proxies calls through to the
            future's result as needed.
